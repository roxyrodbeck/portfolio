      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <br>
      <p>My dad instilled in me a love of Algebra, so I entered the world of secondary math and taught/led for almost ten years. Teaching middle school students math is no easy feat - but it was fun! I loved explaining logic and algorithms in a way they (well, most of them) understood. I even moved into leadership and data analysis for a few years.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Never let them know your next move! After almost a decade of math I frequently found myself in the library and undertaking more non-math responsibilities, such as training (and troubleshooting) our staff on new software. I decided to pursue my love of reading and information and went back to school for my Masters in Library and Information Science.</p>
      <br>
      <p>At this point I was in my first year of motherhood, Hurricane Harvey had flooded our home, we were displaced for 6 months, and I had just been hired as a librarian for the first time. Talk about a whirlwind. (*badum-psh*)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Meanwhile, my love of documenting grew. I went from learning some HTML and CSS for LiveJournal in the early 2000s, to MySpace, then Blogger, and finally WordPress. Some of these skills have assisted me in my current job, where I am also the Campus Communications and Website Coordinator. I recently retired my blog, but it was a wonderful way to unknowingly dip my toe into the career I was meant for.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For the last year I have been studying web development through Scrimba, 100devs, and freeCodeCamp. I may be a junior when it comes to the role of a Software Engineer, but with over 15 years of experience under my belt and my enthusiasm for learning, I would require shorter onboarding and ramp up time. I am well spoken and diplomatic, whether in writing or verbally. My history in math education shows that I can break down complex concepts into more digestible chunks, and my background in library and information science makes me great at research and knowing when to ask for help.</p>
      <br>

        <!-- <p class="tubefeed">I have a "medically complex" son. He receives tube feeds, and during one of the worst years in his short life, he was hospitalized nine times.
        Sometimes the Dieticians would come in and make up a tube feed plan for him. The limited hours and specific amount of milliliters would throw the nursing staff off.
        My husband and I would assist them and sometimes explain the math, which gave me the idea for this calculator.
        Someone could input any two pieces of data, and teh third will appear below the input boxes. -->
